| Plot <td colspan=6>During Rick's incarceration, the Federation has colonized Earth. Summer, determined to rescue Rick, digs up the alternate Rick's corpse in their backyard and retrieves his portal gun. Morty attempts to demonize Rick by transporting himself and Summer to a universe which became a Cronenberg World since the events of the first season's episode, "Rick Potion #9". The two are saved from Morty's original family by the Seal Team Ricks, who send them to the Council of Ricks before proceeding to assassinate Rick upon learning that he is Federation custody to prevent him from revealing their secrets. At the same time, tricking the Federation into believing they had gotten his interdimensional travel formula, Rick manages to hack into their technology to switch bodies with his captors before Seal Team Rick arrives. This forces Rick to improvise by transferring himself into one of the Seal Ricks and kill the others before going to the Citadel of Ricks. Once transferred into a Rick with higher rank, Rick manages to transport the Citadel in the same space as the Federation prison, prompting a massive battle. Rick uses the confusion to access the Federation mainframe—revealed to be his reason for turning himself in— allowing him to make the galactic currency worthless therefore destroying the Federation's economy. The Federation falls into chaos as a result, and leaves Earth. Rick returns to the Smith household, but Jerry issues Beth an ultimatum: choose him or Rick. Beth announces she is leaving Jerry. The status quo restored, Rick reveals to Morty his ulterior motive was to make both the Federation and Jerry "go away", making him Morty's de facto male influence. This devolves into Rick going on a nonsensical angry rant, in homage to his rant in the pilot episode, about how their adventures are about to get darker than before and how his ultimate goal is to get himself some McDonald's Szechuan sauce. <br> Post-Credit Scene: Tammy observes Bird Person's resurrection as a cyborg dubbed "Phoenix Person". <br> Guest starring: Nathan Fillion as The Galactic Federation Agent.
